[["06-seq-ser.html", "Chapter 6 Sequences &amp; series of real numbers 6.1 Sequences 6.2 Series", " Chapter 6 Sequences &amp; series of real numbers (last updated: 4:07:47 PM, February 12, 2026) 6.1 Sequences A sequence of a function whose domain is the natural numbers \\(f(n)\\) with \\(f:\\mathbb N\\to\\mathbb R\\). An example is \\(f(n)=\\frac1n\\) which gives the sequence \\(1,\\frac12,\\frac13,\\ldots\\). Often we use subscript notation instead: \\(x_n=f(n)\\) or \\(a_k=f(k)\\). It is typical to use some kind of bracket notation too: \\((x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}\\) or \\(\\{x_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb N}\\). I prefer using parentheses and not curly braces as I like to restrict curly braces for sets. A sequence is not a set. Here is another common notation: \\((x_n)_{n=1,2,\\ldots}\\). We’ll discuss convergence of sequences first… 6.2 Series A finite series is \\(\\sum_{j=1}^n a_j=a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n\\) and and infinite series is \\(\\sum_{j=1}^n a_j=a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n+a_{n+1}+\\cdots\\) and keeps going on forever.
